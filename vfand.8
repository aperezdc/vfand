.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBvfand [options]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBvfand\fP daemon monitors your Vaio laptop\(aqs system temperature and
adjusts fan speed depending on it. Currently, the adjustment is linear and
is done in the following fashion:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the system temperature is less than the \fIlow\fP threshold, then the
fan is turned off.
.IP \(bu 2
If the system temperature is more than the \fIlow\fP threshold, but less than
the \fIhigh\fP threshold, then the speed is adjusted linearly. Higher
temperature values will cause the fan speed to increase and vice versa.
.IP \(bu 2
If the system temperature is more than the \fIhigh\fP threshold, then the fan
is set to full speed.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When the embedded fan controller does not suffice to keep the machine
cooled, or if your machine is noisy, you can use \fBvfand\fP\&.
.SH USAGE
.sp
The daemon accepts a number of command line options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-i \ SECONDS
Polling interval, in seconds (default: 2). This is the amount
of time to wait before two consecutive fan adjustments. If you
set this too high, your machine could overheat.
.TP
.BI \-H \ DEGREES
Temperature considered \fIhigh\fP (default: 55). When the
temperature is above this value, the fan will be driven to full
speed.
.TP
.BI \-L \ DEGREES
Temperature considered \fIlow\fP (default: 35). When the temperature
falls below this value, the fan will be kept at the minimum
possible speed.
.TP
.B \-v
Print informational messages containing temperature, old speed
and new ones each time the speed is readjusted.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\-h, \-?      Show a help text and exit
.SH CAVEATS
.sp
There is a couple of caveats to keep in mind while using \fBvfand\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The daemon will \fInot detach\fP itself from the controlling terminal. You may
want to launch it from \fIinittab(5)\fP, or with the aid of a process monitor
like \fIsupervise(8)\fP or \fIrunsv(8)\fP\&. A less beautiful option is using
\fIstart\-stop\-daemon(8)\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The daemon will log warnings to standard error, and informative messages to
standard output. If you want to send messages to log files you will need to
use a script or a third\-party tool like \fIrotlog(8)\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Actually, those are design decisions: they keep things simple, and the
aforementioned companion tools are better suited for that tasks.
.SH FILES
.sp
This program uses the \fB/dev/sonypi\fP character device.
